abstract  ="ZnO nanorods were grown on a zinc substrate via cathodic delamination of a polymer coating{,} a tailored corrosion process{,} at room temperature. A comparison between in situ Raman spectra and post mortem cross sectional analysis by Raman spectroscopy{,} photoluminescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy shows that in the initial stages of the synthesis{,} preferentially defect rich ZnO grows. At later stages{,} crystalline wurtzite ZnO growth dominates. The result is nanorod arrays consisting of nanorods with a large density of point defects in the â‰ˆ500 nm range near the zinc substrate{,} and low defect density in the regions further away from the interface. The growth{,} which proceeds over several hours{,} can be interrupted at any time. Large salt concentrations in the corrosive medium increase the growth rate{,} but also the amount of point defects. The resulting rods show strongly position-dependent luminescence and Raman spectra. Different luminescence can thus be selectively excited{,} based on the position of excitation."}
