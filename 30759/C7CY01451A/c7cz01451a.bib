abstract  ="Glycerol is a major by-product of the biodiesel production and is therefore produced in high quantities. While currently there are limited possible applications for this highly functionalized molecule{,} glycerol can be a cheap and abundant feedstock for value-added products that are accessible by selective oxidation. Usually{,} the selective oxidation of glycerol utilizes expensive noble metal catalysts{,} such as Au{,} Pt{,} and Pd. Here we report the selective oxidation of glycerol in basic media{,} using ordered mesoporous Cu–Al2O3 catalysts with various Cu loadings prepared by a facile soft-templating method. The materials were characterized in detail by nitrogen physisorption{,} vis-NIR spectroscopy{,} EDX{,} low- and wide-angle XRD{,} XPS{,} and TEM. Subsequently the reaction conditions for glycerol oxidation were optimized. The catalytic oxidation of glycerol yields C3 products{,} such as glyceric acid and tartronic acid{,} and also C2 and C1 products{,} such as glycolic acid{,} oxalic acid{,} and formic acid. Moreover{,} the role of the solvent on the catalytic reaction was investigated{,} and the addition of various co-solvents to the aqueous reaction mixture was found to increase the initial reaction rate up to a factor of three. The trends of the initial reaction rates correlate well with the polarity of the water/co-solvent mixtures. The prepared Cu–Al2O3 catalysts are a more cost-efficient and environmentally viable alternative to the reported noble metal cataly
