Different architectural topologies have been generated by adjusting the N-donor ligands. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 1 shows a rare 1D → 2D polyrotaxane network. Complex 2 possesses an unprecedented 2-nodal (3,10)-connected 3D framework with a Schläfli symbol of (4<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup>(4<sup>6</sup>·6<sup>32</sup>·8<sup>3</sup>)(4<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup>. When the 2-connected points (H3L and 1,3-bitl ligands) are not calculated, complex 3 shows a hcb uninodal 3-connected 2D network with the Schläfli symbol (6<sup>3</sup>), which further constructs a 3D supramolecular structure through O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds; while the 2-connected points are taken into account, complex 3 exhibits an unprecedented 3-nodal (2,2,4)-connected network. Complex 4 presents an unprecedented 2-nodal (3,5)-connected 3D framework with a (4·6<sup>2</sup>)(4·6<sup>6</sup>·8<sup>3</sup>) topology, while complex 5 exhibits another unprecedented 2-nodal (3,5)-connected 2D framework with a (4<sup>2</sup>·6<sup>7</sup>·8)(4<sup>2</sup>·6) Schläfli symbol and shows 2D → 3D supramolecular structure through O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, the magnetic properties of complexes 2 and 4 are discussed. Moreover, the dye adsorption and mechanism studies indicate that the pore size, the uncoordinated O atoms in carboxyl groups and the uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the MOFs have significant effects on the dye adsorption capacity."
