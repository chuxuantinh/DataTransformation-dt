abstract  ="Five novel Co(ii) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed from semi-flexible 4-(3{,}5-dicarboxylatobenzyloxy)benzoic acid (H3L){,} namely {[Co1.5(HL)(4{,}4[prime or minute]-bidpe)2(H2O)][middle dot]3H2O}n (1){,} {[Co3(L)2(4{,}4[prime or minute]-bibp)3([small mu ]2-O)2][middle dot]2H2O}n (2){,} {[Co(HL)(1{,}3-bitl)][middle dot](1{,}4-Diox)}n (3){,} [Co2(HL)2(3{,}5-bipd)2]n (4){,} and {[Co(HL)(tib)][middle dot]0.5H2O[middle dot]NMP}n (5) (4{,}4[prime or minute]-bidpe = 4{,}4[prime or minute]-bis(imidazolyl)diphenyl ether{,} 4{,}4[prime or minute]-bibp = 4{,}4[prime or minute]-bis(imidazol-1-yl)biphenyl{,} 1{,}3-bitl = 1{,}3-bis(1-imidazoly)toluene{,} 3{,}5-bipd = 3{,}5-bis(1-imidazoly)pyridine{,} and tib = 1{,}3{,}5-tris(1-imidazolyl)benzene){,} were synthesized under solvothermal conditions and further characterized by elemental analysis{,} IR spectra{,} powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD){,} thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Different architectural topologies have been generated by adjusting the N-donor ligands. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 1 shows a rare 1D [rightward arrow] 2D polyrotaxane network. Complex 2 possesses an unprecedented 2-nodal (3{,}10)-connected 3D framework with a Schlafli symbol of (43)2(46[middle dot]632[middle dot]83)(43)2. When the 2-connected points (H3L and 1{,}3-bitl ligands) are not calculated{,} complex 3 shows a hcb uninodal 3-connected 2D network with the Schlafli symbol (63){,} which further constructs a 3D supramolecular structure through O-H[three dots{,} centered]O hydrogen bonds; while the 2-connected points are taken into account{,} complex 3 exhibits an unprecedented 3-nodal (2{,}2{,}4)-connected network. Complex 4 presents an unprecedented 2-nodal (3{,}5)-connected 3D framework with a (4[middle dot]62)(4[middle dot]66[middle dot]83) topology{,} while complex 5 exhibits another unprecedented 2-nodal (3{,}5)-connected 2D framework with a (42[middle dot]67[middle dot]8)(42[middle dot]6) Schlafli symbol and shows 2D [rightward arrow] 3D supramolecular structure through O-H[three dots{,} centered]O hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile{,} the magnetic properties of complexes 2 and 4 are discussed. Moreover{,} the dye adsorption and mechanism studies indicate that the pore size{,} the uncoordinated O atoms in carboxyl groups and the uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the MOFs have significant effects on the dye adsorption capacity."}
