Thermodynamic as well as kinetic principles of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption in the presence of other gases are linked to current approaches of materials development. Whilst hundreds or even thousands of porous materials have been evaluated for CO<sub>2</sub> capture, research in this field is still full of challenges, as for instance a feasible physical adsorbent for CO<sub>2</sub> capture for direct capture from air has still not been found. Current attempts towards the optimization of materials in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake/selectivity, regenerability, tolerance against water, and cost most often exclude each other. The aim of this article is not to summarize all recent attempts towards tailoring of materials for selective CO<sub>2</sub> capture but to discuss the most fundamental aspects of adsorptive CO<sub>2</sub> separation in order to illuminate the “sweet spot” to be explored when electronic structure, polarity, and pore size/geometry are rationally balanced and optimized – just like nature does when exerting selective binding of gases."
